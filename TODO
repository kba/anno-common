[X] Send DOI if set as Link rel="canonical"
[ ] handle multiple creators
[ ] replace axios with fetch-ponyfill
[X] handle DOI minting with revise
[X] mintDoi should take an annotation ID not an annotation
[X] "Cannot set headers after sent" error
[X] Replace 'metadataOnly', 'skipVersions', ... with 'blacklist' and 'whitelist' options to allow/disallow certain props
[X] BUG: import in mongolike creates versions of versions which is very very wrong
[X] ACL is broken for array-creators and string creators?  => mintDoi MUST take anno not annoID :(
[ ] rename user-auth -> jwt-auth
